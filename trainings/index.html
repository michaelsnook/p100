          <h2>Finance Training</h2>
       
          <p>Our finance training teaches the fundamentals of campaign finance work for any level, from local and state to federal races. Through exercises, we learn how to write a finance plan, research donors, run effective call time, file compliance reports, organize successful fundraising events and more!</p>
       
       
          <h2>Field trainings</h2>
       
          <p>Our field training is also appropriate for any level, from local and state to federal. We learn how to calculate win numbers and target voters effectively, write a field plan, write a call script, manage data, manage volunteers and more! Most importantly, we teach the best practices that we've developed over the years through our own work, and that we've learned from our allies.</p>
